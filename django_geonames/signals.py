"""
Signals for this application.

city_items_pre_import
    Emitted by city_import() in the django_geonames command for each row parsed in
    the data file. If a signal reliever raises InvalidItems then it will be
    skipped.

    An example is worth 1000 words: if you want to import only cities from
    France, USA and Belgium you could do as such::

        import django_geonames

        def filter_city_import(sender, items, **kwargs):
            if items[8] not in ('FR', 'US', 'BE'):
                raise django_geonames.InvalidItems()

        django_geonames.signals.city_items_pre_import.connect(filter_city_import)

    Note: this signal gets a list rather than a City instance for performance
    reasons.

region_items_pre_import
    Same as city_items_pre_import, for example::

        def filter_region_import(sender, items, **kwargs):
            if items[0].split('.')[0] not in ('FR', 'US', 'BE'):
                raise django_geonames.InvalidItems()
        django_geonames.signals.region_items_pre_import.connect(
            filter_region_import)

filter_non_cities()
    By default, this reciever is connected to city_items_pre_import, it raises
    InvalidItems if the row doesn't have PPL in its features (it's not a
    populated place).
